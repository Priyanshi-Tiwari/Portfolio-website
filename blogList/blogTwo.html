        <h2>What is Semantic HTML?</h2>
        <p>
            HTML tags are classified into two types :
            Semantic elements and non-semantic elements.<br><br>

            Semantic means connected with meaning. So semantic HTML elements are those elements that describe their own
            meaning.
            Elements such as &ltheader&gt,&ltfooter&gt,&ltsection&gt etc are considered semantic elements because they
            describe on
            their own what they are used for and the type of content that will be enclosed within these tags.<br><br>

            A semantic element describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.<br><br>

            Non-semantic elements are the elements that tell you nothing about the content inside them.<br>
            Examples of non-semantic elements are &ltspan&gt and &ltdiv&gt.<br><br>

            <img class="imageTwo" src="/images/html1.jpg"><br>

            In older version of HTML people used the non-semantic &ltdiv&gt tag to describe elements. They used class or
            id to describe its purpose. For Example &ltdiv class=”header”&gt, &ltdiv class=”footer”&gt,&ltdiv
            class=”navigation”&gt.This looks okay when you have to write just a few lines of code but as a programmer, we
            have to write thousands of lines of code and this is when it becomes troublesome and difficult to read by
            both the browser and the developer. Here comes the semantic elements to your rescue.<br><br>

            <ul>
                Examples of semantic elements:
                <li>&ltheader&gt: It is the introductory section of the page</li>
                <li>&ltfooter&gt: It is located at the bottom of the page. It contains contact and copyright
                    information,
                    sitemaps etc.</li>
                <li>&ltmain&gt: It defines the main content of the document</li>
                <li>&ltsection&gt:It is used to define a section in the document. It can contain an introduction, content,
                    contact information etc.</li>
                <li> &ltnav&gt: It is used to define navigational links in the form of a navigation bar or menu.</li>
                <li> &ltarticle&gt: It contains independent content which does not require any other context.</li>
                <li> &ltaside&gt: It is used to place the content in the sidebar.</li>
                <li>&ltfigure&gt:It is used to add images,diagrams,illustrations etc.</li>
                <li>&ltfigcaption&gt: It is used to add a small caption.</li>
                <li>&ltdetails&gtIt adds additional information that user can view or hide.</li>
                <li> &ltmark&gt: It is used to highlight the text.</li>
                <li> &ltsummary&gt: it defines a heading for the details element.</li>
            </ul><br>
            Advantages of using Semantic elements<br><br>
            1)It is easier to read.<br>
            For example: &lth1&gt is a semantic element. It tells the browser that it is a top-level heading. The browser
                automatically increases the font of the text inside the h1 tag to make it look like a heading<br>
                &lth1&gtThis is a h1 heading&lt/h1&gt<br>
                Or you can also write it like<br>
                &ltspan style=“font-size:32px”&gtThis is also a h1 heading&lt/span&gt<br>
                But this does not have any semantic value. It does not tell anything about it’s meaning.<br><br>

                Using semantic elements not only makes it easier for the browser to read the code but the developer. It
                makes your code more consistent.<br><br>

                2)Improved search engine rankings: search engines take into account the semantic elements as important
                keyword and influence the rank of the page.<br><br>

                3)Makes it easier for the screen reader which helps the visually impaired people to navigate through the
                page.

                In conclusion, the semantic elements describe their own meaning and purpose and the type of content
                inside them. We should use it for better accessibility, readability and better indexing.
